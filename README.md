Museo
=====

A mashup of Youtube and Last.fm.

This application requires the cURL module.

If you wish to host this on your own server, then you will need to do the following:


1. You need a last.fm user account and to [register to use the API](http://www.last.fm/api/account/create).
2. Rename the file php/config-sample.php to php/config.php.
3. Enter your Last.fm API key and secret.
4. MUSEO_CONFIG_PROXY is used only if the server is running behind a proxy, and this was needed when I was developing it originally using the university wireless network.
